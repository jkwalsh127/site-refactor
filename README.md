# Site Refactor to Enhance Accessibility


## Description

For this project, I was starting with a simple document that was built to imitate a
landing page for a marketing service. My goal was to improve some accessibility aspects
without changing the original appearance on the user side. 


## The Process

The starting code had at least one bug, had poor structuring of heading tags, and did not
include any semantic tags or alt attritubtes to images.

My approach was to approach the improvements in sections, doing so in the following order:
1. fixing any bugs apparent in the GUI
    - Everything worked well, except a singular link in the main `<nav>` that was not directing the user to intended portion of the page. 
2. laying out the site with semantic tags
3. adding comments throughout to identify the purpose of each portion of code. 
4. provided better structure for the heading tags 
5. added `alt` attributes to all `<img>`
6. gave an appropriate `<title>`
